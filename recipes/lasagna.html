        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made from layers of flat pasta, meat-based sauce (often with ground beef or pork), creamy cheese like ricotta or béchamel, and topped with melted mozzarella and Parmesan.

This hearty dish is perfect for gatherings, as it can be prepared in large portions and served easily.</p1>
